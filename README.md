# PowerCARM
A open-source tool to generate the POWERCARM model [as mentioned in the paper "Beyond the Roofline: Cache-Aware Power and Energy-Efficiency Modeling for Multi-Cores" by Alexandar illic etal.]  which eventually helps to determine total power roof of the underlying architecture. 
This tool is derived or is an extension of already available open-source tool Locality aware roofline tool by NicolasDenoyelle , which generates CARM for the underlying microarchitecture.
If this tool is helpful in any way then please site both NicolasDenoyelle and ShikharJain97.
